Community Ground Slot Booking

Project Description:

The Community Sport Ground Slot Booking System is a simple Java project designed to help users reserve time slots for community sports grounds in an organized way. Instead of manually writing down bookings on paper, this system allows users (like players, coaches, or community members) to check available slots and book them easily through the application.

In many communities, people play sports like cricket, football, badminton, and more, but managing ground bookings manually can cause conflicts (two people booking the same slot) or confusion. This system solves that problem by keeping track of dates, times, and bookings in a structured program.

This project lets users:

View all available sport ground slots

Book a slot for a chosen date and time

Cancel a booked slot

See existing bookings

It’s built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, and helps students learn how to manage data, handle user choices, and build a simple real-world application. This project is useful for learning programming basics and understanding how reservation or booking systems work.
